This application retrieves the data of the first 10 articles according to the keyword entered from Google Academics. This data extraction process is done using web scrapping techniques. Libraries such as Beautifulsoup and Request were used. Django web framework was used to show the results. There is also the option to download pdf files to get more detailed information about the articles. Timing was also used to avoid problems with consecutive requests.
